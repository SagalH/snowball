            <h1>The Issue | The Earths lungs on Fire.</h1>
            <p>
                Last summer we all remember the Amazon being the number one topic on the news. For weeks on end the vital, biodiverse and largest rainforest on earth was burning in front of the worlds eyes. And after that the media cycle found another number one topic. Yet the problem and consequences remained. Species were endangered and posing a threat to not only the health of indigenous people living in the Amazonas, but also their way of life. 
                
                Since of the fires were not natural, but illegal fires. By illegal fires we mean thousands of kilometres being cleared for crop or grazing by farmers. </p>

            <h1>Our Solution</h1>
            <p>
                Our solution is an already widespread method, but has not been used to its full extent when it comes to this issue: sanctions. 

Economical and trading sanctions is a proven effective way to get results, and to make countries change their behaviour. Since the fires that have been taking place are mostly in Brazils part of the rainforest, they would receive these sanctions.

            <h1>If not</h1>
            <p>The Amazonas makes up around 20% of the worlds carbon store, and is therefore vital to slow down the pace of global warming. 

                The effects of global warming include: more extreme weather, water levels rising and more extinct species.
                
                And these consequences of human overconsumption, wastefulness and lack of consdieration for the environment can change our way of life.
